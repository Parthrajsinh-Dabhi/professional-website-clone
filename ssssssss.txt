Subject: Urgent Request for Updated Evaluation and Forwarding of Documents

Dear Uni Assist Team,

Since my initial application through Uni Assist, I have completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, and I now possess my final transcript with an improved CGPA of 8.12 (equivalent to a 1.9 German grade). Alongside this, I have obtained a provisional degree certificate.

Given these updates, I kindly request the following actions to be taken as soon as possible:

1. Updated Evaluation:
   - Please re-evaluate my application considering my latest academic achievements (1.9 German grade, 8.12 CGPA).
   - After re-evaluation, kindly send the updated evaluation result to all universities where my application has been forwarded by Uni Assist.

2. Forward Documents to All Universities:
   - Please forward my final transcript and provisional degree certificate to all universities where my application has been forwarded by Uni Assist.

3. VPD for University of Bayreuth:
   - Provide me with the VPD (Vorpr√ºfungsdokumentation) required for my application to the University of Bayreuth.

4. Application to TU Dortmund:
   - Ensure that my recent application to TU Dortmund is also forwarded promptly.

I am aware that many universities have already begun their evaluation processes, and timely submission of updated documents is crucial for my application status. Therefore, I would appreciate it if these tasks could be expedited.

Thank you very much for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your swift response.
